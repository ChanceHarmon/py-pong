# Welcome to Pong with Python

## The original tutorial is sourced from freeCodeCamp.org
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6jJg9Zan7w

## The finished version with my notes can be found in the finished-tutorial branch

### Notes of things that still need to be addressed for a clean program:
    - Establish an end point for gameplay i.e. score limit to end while loop
    - Refine paddle vs ball collision
    - Paddles have no up or down limit, become undefined when outsid eof game board
    - What happens when game loop breaks?
        - Do we need to re-draw a new board with a different message?
        - Offer input to play again
    - Game loop needs to have the bool assigned to a variable for more control
    - Sound leaves more to be desired
    
### I will continue to update as the above issues get addressed.
